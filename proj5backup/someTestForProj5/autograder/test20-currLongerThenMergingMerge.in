## Test case A: Any files that have been modified in the given branch since the split point, but not modified in the current branch since the split point #should be changed to their versions in the given branch (checked out from the commit at the front of the given branch). These files should then all be #automatically staged. To clarify, if a file is "modified in the given branch since the split point" this means the version of the file as it exists in #the commit at the front of the given branch has different content from the version of the file at the split point.
#
## Test case B: Any files that have been modified in the current branch but not in the given branch since the split point should stay as they are.
#
## Test case C: Any files that have been modified in the current branch but not in the given branch since the split point should stay as they are.
