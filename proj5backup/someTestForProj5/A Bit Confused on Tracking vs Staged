A Bit Confused on Tracking vs Staged


Question:
Say I have wug.txt, which is unstaged and untracked, and has contents "Wug"Then I call

java gitlet/Main add wug.txt
java gitlet/Main commit "Some message"
Then, I modify wug.txt to have the contents "Wug!"

Then, without adding wug.txt again, I call

java gitlet/Main commit "New message"
Does the version of wug.txt stored/referenced by my second commit contain "Wug" or "Wug!"? 
In other words, do I have to re-add a file every time I change it's contents, even if it's already tracked?


Answer 1:
You have to re-add each time.
