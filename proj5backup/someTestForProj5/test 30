For test30, I don't understand why line 17 should return true:

1. # Create two branches and switch between them
2. I prelude1.inc
3. > branch other
4. <<<
5. + f.txt wug.txt
6. + g.txt notwug.txt
7. > add g.txt
8. <<<
9. > add f.txt
10. <<<
11. > commit "Main two files"
12. <<<
13. E f.txt
14. E g.txt
15. > checkout other
16. <<<
17. * f.txt
18. * g.txt

Can someone please explain?


Answer 1:
* f.txt means: Assert the f.txt does not exist in the current directory.

Going through the commands:

After line 3, we have master and other pointing to the initial commit. Our current branch is master.

*master
   0
 other
After adding and committing g.txt and f.txt on the master branch:

other          *master
  0---------------1
After checking out to other:

*other         master
   1-------------2
Other is still pointing to the initial commit which has no files tracked.

Therefore switching to it would mean that we have no files in our working directory, especially not f.txt ot g.txt.
